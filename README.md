# Marketplace
One of my pet-projects with use of UIKit, Cocoapods abd Firebase.
This App is a local job Marketplace, which should give people possibility to offer services 
and find professionals in the area.

Potential functionality: 
- Find another users from your area, who provide services you need
- Offer services, you could provide
- Map and search functions
- Chat
- Manage your open orders with to-do lists and a calendar
- Create invoices as PDF

Implemented:
- Sign up, sign in, email and phone number confirmation
- Create to-do lists and folders for structuring
- Create invoices as PDF

Work in progress:
- Calendar
- Chat
- Search function

Implemented API:
- Firebase as a database
- Kingfisher for downloading and caching images
- MessageKit for chat functions 

Extra information:
- The arhcitecture pattern is MVC, as the easiest one, since the project was supposed to be
not too sophisticated and designed only by myself
- Mock-up was made with the use of story-boards (as the easiest and fastest way) and gradually replaced with 
programmatic design (for —Åontrol and UI-Design purposes)
- I planned to add more comments into code, but haven't managed it yet - sorry =)
